				h1 Now, on to your business tax setup
				p
					| We can help your business get a federal tax identification number as well as a consultation on best practices to maximize your tax savings.
				h3 Do you want help getting a federal tax ID (EIN)?
				p
					| Most businesses are required to obtain a federal tax identification number (also known as an EIN) from the IRS. This number is used when filing tax returns, opening business bank accounts, or paying employees (if applicable). Additionally, an EIN keeps your personal social security number private in business transactions.
				p
					| We can do all of the work to obtain the tax identification number for you or just prepare your paperwork for you to file yourself. (
					a#help_ein.help see fee details
					| ).
