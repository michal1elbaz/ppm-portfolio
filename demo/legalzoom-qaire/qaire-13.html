        <p>A Registered Agent may also be called a "Statutory Agent," "Resident Agent," "Clerk," or "Agent for Service of Process," depending on the state in which you are forming your entity.</p>
        <p>When specifying a registered agent for your business, the agent must either be (1) an adult individual living in the state of formation with a valid street address (no P.O. boxes), or (2) a company, such as LegalZoom, authorized to serve as an agent.</p>
        <p>If you choose your own registered agent:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The agent must have a PHYSICAL address (no P.O. boxes) in the state of formation, and the name and address will become PUBLIC information on state records</li>
          <li>The agent will receive "junk‚Äù mail solicitations on your behalf</li>
          <li>Process servers will visit the address listed by the agent to deliver service of process</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you choose LegalZoom as your registered agent:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Our information becomes public on state records and websites so your privacy is better protected</li>
          <li>We send you monthly email alerts of important state and federal filing requirements and deadlines</li>
          <li>You'll have unlimited access to the LegalZoom Corporate Center and you can call us with any questions you may have about state and federal filing requirements</li>
          <li>We accept service of process, and promptly and discreetly forward all legal documents and official state correspondence that we receive on your behalf</li>
          <li>We archive and securely store copies of all important mail that we receive on your behalf and can send you replacement copies if yours are lost or misplaced</li>
        </ul>
        <p>LegalZoom's registered agent service only starts when your LLC is legally effective. The cost is $159 per year, but there is no immediate charge. At the time we receive official notification that your LLC has been registered, your card will automatically be charged $159. The service renews annually thereafter for the same fee, billed to your card. You may cancel the service at any time by calling us at (866) 698-0052, or service will continue.</p>
