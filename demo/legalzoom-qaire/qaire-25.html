        <h1>Give your business an advantage</h1>
        <p>Because LegalZoom has helped thousands of real estate investors and managers get started, we know you'll need these forms in the first months of business:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><span>General Agreement</span></li>
          <li><span>Property Management Agreement</span></li>
          <li><span>Commercial Rent Application</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p>That's why your LLC includes these critical forms - and hundreds more - free as part of the Business Advantage membership. Your membership includes unlimited use of our extensive library of business forms. You can download these forms that are essential to running your business on demand, as many times as you want, for no additional charge.</p>
        <p>Plus, as an added benefit, you get CreditAlert&#8482; Plus from Dun & Bradstreet Credibility Corp. to start building your company's credit profile (will contact you separately). Here's what's included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span>A D&B D-U-N-SÂ® Number, is used by industries and organizations around the world as a global standard for business identification and training (will be assigned 4-6 weeks after your business is officially formed)</span></li>
          <li><span>CreditAlert&#8482; to provide email alerts to changes to your business credit scores and ratings by Dun & Bradstreet Credibility Corp.</span></li>
          <li><span>A customizable profile in the D&B Credibility Review&#8482; online business directory</span></li>
        </ul>
