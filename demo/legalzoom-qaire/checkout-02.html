                      <p><strong>Company Record-Keeping and Formalities</strong><br>Clearly states that regular meetings of managers or members are NOT required</p>
                      <p><strong>Ownership and Profit Sharing</strong><br>Governs how profits are distributed to the members and provides the method for admitting new members into the LLC</p>
                      <p><strong>Withdrawal and Dissolution</strong><br>Provides a method for how members may withdraw and how the company may be dissolved</p>
                      <p><strong>Restrictions on Transfer</strong><br>This provision in the Operating Agreement specifies when and how a member of the LLC is allowed to sell his or her interest to a third party. During our online questionnaire, you can decide whether or not to include any transfer restrictions.</p>
                      <p><strong>Bank Account Provision</strong><br>Authorizes the company to open a business bank account. Many banks require that the company adopt such a provision before opening an account</p>
