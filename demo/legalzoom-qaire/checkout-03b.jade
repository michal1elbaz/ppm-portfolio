					h2 Installment Plan Billing Terms
					p
						| By opting into the Installment Plan, I am agreeing to make an initial payment (the "Initial Installment Payment") immediately when I place my order. I hereby authorize LegalZoom to charge my credit card two additional installments on approximately, but not before, the first and second month anniversaries (each an "Installment Billing Date") of my Initial Installment Payment. If my purchase date is on the 29th through the 31st day of any month, an Installment Billing Date for months with fewer days will fall on the last day of the month. Each payment will be of the same amount, except that if the total purchase price does not divide evenly into three parts, my final installment payment will include all outstanding amounts. I understand that I may pay my outstanding balance at any time without incurring additional charges.
					p
						| I also agree to the complete
						a(href='#') Terms of Service
