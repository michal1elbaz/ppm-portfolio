            <br />
            (a) Grant of License. Subject to these Press Center Terms of Use, LegalZoom hereby grants you:<br />
            <br />
            (1) a limited, non-exclusive, nontransferable, royalty free, revocable license to download and use the content located in the Press Center of the LegalZoom web site, which content may include downloadable photos and logos, drawings, trademarks, and rendered images (the “LZ Licensed Property”), solely for Licensed Uses, as described in greater detail below.<br />
            <br />
            (2) No other right or license, whether express or implied, is granted to you by LegalZoom with respect to any other trademark, trade name, copyright, or other intellectual property right owned, possessed, or licensed by or to LegalZoom. You agree that you will not use the LZ Licensed Property in any manner not specifically authorized by these Press Center Terms of Use.

            <br />
            (3) LegalZoom reserves the right in its sole discretion to terminate or modify your permission to display the LZ Licensed Property and to take action against any use that does not conform to these terms and conditions, infringes any LegalZoom intellectual property or other right, or violates applicable law.<br />
            <br />
            (b) General Responsibilities.<br />
            <br />
            (1) You agree that you will use the LZ Licensed Property only as expressly permitted in these Press Center Terms of Use and only in the manner expressly set forth herein. You agree that you will not modify, sell, create derivatives, transfer, transmit, assign, sublicense, pledge, or otherwise use any of the LZ Licensed Property except as otherwise expressly permitted herein and only in accordance with these Press Center Terms of Use.<br />
            <br />
            (2) You agree that you will not, and will not assist any third party to, register or attempt to register any portion of the LZ Licensed Property or any colorable variation thereof as a trademark, service mark, copyright, trade dress, patent, or otherwise in your own name, and that you will cooperate fully as requested by LegalZoom in connection with any registration of any portion of the LZ Licensed Property by LegalZoom.<br />
            <br />
            (3) The rights granted hereunder are conditioned on your full and complete compliance with the provisions of these Press Center Terms of Use and on your full and complete compliance (i) with the notice provisions of the trademark, copyright, or intellectual property laws of the United States, and (ii) as otherwise required by LegalZoom.<br />
            <br />
            (c) Specific Limitations.<br />

            <br />
            (3) The LZ Licensed Property may not be used to suggest that LegalZoom owns, endorses, or sponsors products and services other than the products and services of LegalZoom.<br />

            <br />
            (d) Reproduction of Trademarks. The trademarks, service marks, trade names, and trade dress of LegalZoom are valuable assets.

By using a LegalZoom trademark, in whole or in part, you are acknowledging that LegalZoom is the sole owner of the trademark and promising that you will not interfere with the rights of LegalZoom in the trademark, including challenging the use, registration of, or application to register such trademark of LegalZoom, alone or in combination with other words, anywhere in the world, and that you will not harm, misuse, or bring into disrepute any LegalZoom trademark.<br />
            <br />
            (1) In Text. Media and the press may use the LegalZoom word mark in text without prior approval from LegalZoom, provided that the uses are truthful, fair, and not misleading. However, you may not use any LegalZoom logos unless specifically authorized by LegalZoom to do so.<br />
