        The LegalZoom $50,000 Peace of Mind Guarantee <span class="small">(Personal Services)</span>
      </h1>
      <p>
        LegalZoom was founded by attorneys with experience at some of the best law firms in the country. That's why we can offer the following guarantee.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your Last Will and Testament is found by a court of competent jurisdiction within the United States to be invalid solely because it was created online through an Internet website, we will pay you $50,000.
