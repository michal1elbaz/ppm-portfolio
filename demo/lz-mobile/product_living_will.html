            <p>
              In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.

              <strong>LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:</strong>
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <span>If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.</span>

            <p>
              LegalZoom was founded by attorneys with experience at some of the best law firms in the country. That's why we can offer the following guarantee.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your Last Will and Testament is found by a court of competent jurisdiction within the United States to be invalid solely because it was created online through an Internet website, we will pay you $50,000.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Guarantee Details</strong>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>To make a claim on the guarantee, your attorney-in-fact or conservator or guardian or your estate (collectively, "you") must notify us in writing within 30 days after a challenge has been made to the validity of your Last Will and Testament ("Will") because it was created through the Internet and before any ruling. Notices should be sent by U.S. certified mail to our corporate headquarters, Attn: General Counsel. Your attorney-in-fact or conservator or guardian or your estate are the only people who may initiate a claim on this guarantee. Claims cannot be made on a class or representative basis.</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>This guarantee does not cover any failure by you to abide by our Terms of Use or Terms of Service, any situation where there is comparative or contributory negligence by anyone (other than LegalZoom), or any failure to meet any subsequent requirements after you receive your Will from LegalZoom, including, but not limited to:</span>
